RAG-auto-email-reply
This repository contains the code for an automated email reply system leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide intelligent and context-aware responses. The system is designed to streamline email communication by automating replies based on the content and context of incoming emails.

Project Overview
The RAG-auto-email-reply project aims to automate the process of replying to emails by intelligently understanding the email content, gathering necessary context, and generating appropriate responses. It integrates with Outlook for email management and uses a RAG-based approach for generating replies.

Features
Automated Email Processing: Automatically fetches and processes incoming emails from Outlook.

Context Gathering: Gathers relevant information and context for accurate reply generation.

RAG-based Reply Generation: Utilizes a Retrieval-Augmented Generation model to create intelligent and context-aware email replies.

NDA Signing Facilitation: Includes a specific flow for handling and facilitating NDA signing processes.

System Architecture
The system is built around several Python modules, each handling a specific part of the email reply automation process. The core logic involves fetching emails, extracting information, querying a knowledge base (implicitly, through context gathering), and generating replies.

Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/RAG-auto-email-reply.git
cd RAG-auto-email-reply

Create a virtual environment (recommended):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt # You'll need to create this file with your dependencies

(Note: You will need to create a requirements.txt file listing all necessary Python packages, e.g., pandas, openai, exchangelib for Outlook integration, etc.)

Configuration:

Set up your Outlook API credentials or any other necessary API keys (e.g., for your RAG model, if it's an external service) as environment variables or in a configuration file (e.g., config.ini or .env). Do not commit sensitive information directly to the repository.

Usage
To run the main email processing flow:

python RAG.py

This will initiate the main flow, which involves fetching emails, processing them, and generating replies based on the defined logic.

File Structure
The project is organized into the following main files:

Detailed System Flows
This image details the three main operational flows:

Flow 1 (Main flow): Describes the primary process of receiving an email, analyzing it, gathering context, and generating a reply.

Flow 2 (Facilitate NDA signing): Outlines the specific steps involved in handling requests related to NDA signing.

Flow 3 (Context gathering): Details how the system collects and processes information to build context for email replies.
